# Changelog: A1 Mini Optimized Start Routine

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [1.4.2] - 2026-06-21
- Updated `machine-start-default.gcode` to the Bambu Studio A1 Mini default dated `20260513`.
- Reviewed Bambu Studio's newer PLA-specific AMS flush temperature handling and intentionally left it out of `machine-start.gcode`.
- Documented long-running stability: this routine has been tested since `20251111` across roughly 2,000 print hours.

## [1.4.1] - 2026-04-11
- Tuned the 0.4mm nozzle startup sound to be similar to the Digivice alert sound.
- Added `g-code-player.html` to test various startup sounds by emulating the A1 Mini.
- Added tone options for different startup sounds.

## [1.4.0] - 2026-04-10
- Reworked startup flow for a quieter, faster, and more deliberate routine.
- Improved early homing and guarded recovery for safer startup motion.
- Better staged heating, cleaning, leveling, and calibration handoff.
- Improved nozzle cleaning with a stronger knock sequence, dual-offset brushing, and final wipe passes.
- Uses a 170C cleaning phase with hotter-material temperature clamping.
- Improved startup comments and displayed status messages.
- Refined motion behavior to reduce wasted movement and unnecessary jostling.
- Labeled startup sound blocks for easier swapping or removal.
